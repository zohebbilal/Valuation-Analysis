I'm excited to share my recent valuation Model project built as part of my practice in financial modeling and valuation. For this project, I selected Britannia Industries Limited, is one of Indiaâ€™s leading food companies. It is renowned for its wide range of biscuits, breads, dairy products, and other snacks. Aim to explore the potential of applying advanced valuation techniques in the FMCG sector. This model includes: âœ… Snapshot for overall view of the transaction âœ… Transaction input & assumptions âœ… DCF Analysis âœ… Company Comparable Analysis âœ… Ratio Analysis âœ… Altman's Z Score Analysis âœ… DuPont Analysis âœ… Equity Analyst Coverage âœ… Football Field Analysis

ðŸ’¡ Objective: This exercise aimed to deepen my understanding of transaction structuring, and valuation adjustments.

As a finance professional and passion for financial modeling, valuations, and M&A analysis, I am always eager to work on real-world deal scenarios. Always striving to enhance my expertise in this area, and I look forward to continuing to work on complex financial models and transactions in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions on improving the model, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts!
